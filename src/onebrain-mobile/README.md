# onebrain-mobile

> OneBrain Mobile — autonomous iOS and Android node.
>
> Status: **implementation scaffold; target architecture and product
> decomposition documented, production capability not yet claimed**

## Target

OneBrain Mobile is not a desktop companion or a thin client to
`onebrain-api`. The installation owns its NodeID/signing domains, private vault,
local knowledge, Concept Registry release, journals, media, and intermittent
network lifecycle.

Target stack:

```text
Flutter UI
  -> generated Pigeon API
  -> Swift/Kotlin NativeHost
  -> stable C ABI/JNI
  -> autonomous Rust mobile core
```

The product remains useful offline with every LLM and network lane disabled.
Optional device, app-managed, or remote LLM providers return candidate data;
Rust policy and deterministic handlers own every tool and durable side effect.
